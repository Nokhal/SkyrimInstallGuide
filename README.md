This is intended to be semi retard proof.

## Buying and installing the game 
  
Have a steam account.           
Go to https://store.steampowered.com/sub/626153/ and buy The Eldar Scrolls V: Skyrime Special Edition as well as The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Anniversary Upgrade                    
**Install the game on an SSD**                

Once the game is installed, launch the game, go to Creation Clubs and select download all 
![Download All](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1c2pkRK_YGjiiyhdU9AbFUL07AfdAriTz)

The download will take some time. Once completed, skyrim will ask to reload the game.

You can start the game now if you want for the Skyrim - Anniversary Edition completely vanilla experience. (No Mods outside of the paid one of anniversary edition).

## Setting up the modding framework.   
   
Create an account on https://www.nexusmods.com   
   
Download [Vortex Mod Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/)                
Install it on the same drive as Skyrim.                
Launch it, and let it detect/manually setup Skyrim AE installation folder.              
Then, and that's very important, setup Vortex **Mod Staging Folder** to be in the **SAME DRIVE AS SKYRIM**. For that purpose create a new folder in your drive and then pickup this folder from vortex.
